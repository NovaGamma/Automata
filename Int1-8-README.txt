This is the project of the group Int1-8

Elvin was the main contributor to the project, but not all the function were written by him,
but he rewrote and optimized them, hence the code that seems written by only one person


Elvin's Note

I just wanted to clarify some things about the Int2-6 group, you may find the code of our project similar, I agree with that for some parts
Here are some explanation about why:

I helped this group to learn some python techniques and tricks (hence some parts of our code may seem similar)
mainly technics such as ternary operators and list comprehension (that are described in the Examples file)
I also helped them a bit on the data structure, which is a bit similar, but not entirely the same, but as the data structure is similar, the algorithm to implement standarization, to load the automaton from a file, to display the automaton are similar
But those functions such as the standardization or determinization were entirely written by them
Even if they asked me to helped them resolve some problems as one would seek help on the internet.

Moreover as it's explained in their code and in multiple places in ours, the way they display the transition table is using a library that I rewrote
Earlier I sent you an email asking if it was ok to used an external library to display the table and you agreed
But for the sake of it to be easier to use for you I rewrote the library myself (The file Int1_8_Table.py)
and they are also using it. It's the same as if they were using an external library.
This code is not commented because I do not consider it to be part of the project
